Correspondences between the *Solar System* and Ptolemy's distance values from *Moon* to *Saturn*, $r=.981$, $n=7$, $det=96.33$*%*. Ptolemy's model (see Goldstein, 1967) has an extent of $d_P=12756000km$ or $d_P=0.85au$ to the Stars, a size that approximately corresponds to the distance given between *Venus and Earth* ($d=128904000km$ or $d=0.86au$, res.).

Correspondences between the *Solar Systems* of *Velho* and *Ptolemy* from *Luna* to *Saturno*, $r=.998$, $n=7$, $det=99.66$*%*. As far as the distance values ​​in the area between *Moon* and *Saturn* are concerned, the two models from Velho and Ptolemy can be considered *equivalent* (mean ratio factor $\overline{r}=\frac{1}{1.06}$), only the *Firmamento* is $n=1.67$ times as far away at Velho. This firmament is incidentally referred to by Ptolemy as *Stars of first magnitude*.
